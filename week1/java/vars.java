// Soooo, things are different in Java
// Java is strictly Object Oriented, and typed
// pretty much everything has to be very explicit

public class Test {
    // im sure you know about visibility and class modifiers, and input/return types
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        String nameOfVar = "value";
        double nameOfVar = 1.1;
    }
}
