// in Java, most data structures are manually built
// along with their methods to manipulate them
// this is why we hear about "Linked List" questions in coding interviews
// I think perhaps the exception are arrays
// there are I believe of only a single type, and sized
// you have to determine to length of them before hand

// this is a pro and con of Java
// you can write eveything yourself, with the correct data types - which can make things ultra fast when compiled to java byte code and run on the JVM
// but its going to take more time

public class Test {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        int testArray[];
        testArray = new int[10];
        // or
        int[] testArray2 = new int [10];
    }
}
