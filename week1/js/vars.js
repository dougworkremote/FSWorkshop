// how vars used to be used in js
var name_of_var = "value";
// this is a comment BTW
var nameOfVar = 1.1;
// var names are camelCased or with _'s via preference
// with ES6, we have new var types
// let and const
// both are block scoped, which means used w/in context of surrounding {...}
// const is constant, and its value cannot change
// in the case of 'const nameOfConst = { 'prop': val, ...}, vals of properties of nameOfConst can change/be modified
// we can also add props to nameOfConst
